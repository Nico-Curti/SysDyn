# Systems Dynamics Functions and Examples

The project is developed as tutorial for the courses *Complex System* and *Numerical Methods* at the University of Bologna.

Different methods about **Systems Dynamics** research are shown from the simplest ones to more advanced topics. The simplest code are written in **Python** language while the most (computationally) expensive ones are written in **C++**.

## Installation

To build the C++ scripts:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nico-Curti/SysDyn.git
cd SysDyn
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

**NOTE**: make sure that your c++ compiler supports the standard required! If some troubles occur follow the instruction at [intrphysycom](https://github.com/physycom/intrphysycom) page to configure your machine or use the scripts in [ShUt](https:://github.com//Nico-Curti/shut) if you are looking for *no root users* solutions.
